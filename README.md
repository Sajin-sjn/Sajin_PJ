🚀 **Launching My Demo Portfolio: From Local to Public!** 🌐

I’m excited to share that I’ve just taken a significant step forward with my demo portfolio project. I’m transitioning from development to the spotlight by deploying it to a public URL. This move isn’t just about going live—it’s about making a mark and striving for visibility!

🌟 **Goals:**
- **Deploy:** Move the project from local to a publicly accessible URL.
- **Optimize:** Implement best practices for deployment.
- **Rank:** Aim to achieve a high ranking on Google and increase visibility.

Stay tuned as I navigate this journey of making my work accessible to the world and watch as it climbs the ranks on Google!
